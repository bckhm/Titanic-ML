# Titanic-ML
Binary classification of whether passengers aboard the Titanic survived, using various Machine Learning models. Based on Kaggle's [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview/description) competition.

## Goal

"Knowing from a training set of samples listing passengers who survived or did not survive the Titanic disaster, can our model determine based on a given test dataset not containing the survival information, if these passengers in the test dataset survived or not."

## Strategies Employed
Because of the need for classification the employed ML models are as follows:
    • Logistic Regressionm
    • Sigmoid-activated Neural Networks
    • Gradient Boosted Trees
    
We test the most optimal result for these models in the training set, before testing OOS.

### Requirements 
    • Python 3
    • TensorFlow
    • numpy
    • pandas
    • matplotlib.pyplot
    • seaborn
    • xgboost
    • sklearn
    • Jupyter Notebook / Lab
