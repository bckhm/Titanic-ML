# Breast-Cancer-Detection
Binary classification of whether passengers aboard the Titanic survived, using various Machine Learning models. Based on Kaggle's [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview/description) competition.

## Goal

"Knowing from a training set of samples listing passengers who survived or did not survive the Titanic disaster, can our model determine based on a given test dataset not containing the survival information, if these passengers in the test dataset survived or not."
